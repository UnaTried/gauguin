Optimizations:

- Optimize layout of both the main screen and the new game screen. There should be now a better chance to display a consistent layout which matches the current window size.
- Optimize scrolling in new game screen.

Bug fixes:

- Fix layout of the main screen when using a 8' tablet with aspect ratio of e.g. 16:9.
